_As before, this template provides some of the structure you should have for your assignment, but the official instructions and guidance can be found on Canvas.  Make sure to reference that for detailed instructions on what you need to do and what you need to submit to get credit._

## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data
This is a bar graph of all countries that reported _General government debt_ in 2023, an our focus is drawn to the North American countries: _US_ and _Canada_ here.

## Working with Tableau
I tried visualizing the **debt-to-GDP** ratios of countries in the best way - first with the line plots, but it didn't help in identifying which countries had a higher or lower ratio, so I used a **highlight table** with an Orange-Blue diverging color palette to show countries with a **low debt-to-GDP ratio (_less than 100_)** in shades of **blue** and the ones with a **higher ratio** are shown in shades of **orange**. For example, **Japan** in 2018 had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio of **238.7** which is reflected by the dark orange in that cell entry. Some countries that didn't report any data are left blank with a white space in our table.

  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1730591501333');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

## Part three: create your own visualization

_Create another data visualization using the same data used earlier. DO NOT submit something that's just a minor modification of one of the visualizations already covered here. So, don't just modify the colors or labels of one of the earlier examples and call it good, or submit a slightly modified bar chart.  Instead, see what you can come up with on your own, and spend some time to try and create something that tells a story about the data._

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work.  Could someone follow your process and understand what you did?  Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text?  Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_
