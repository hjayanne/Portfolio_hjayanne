# About me

Hi, my name is Hemalatha Jayanne Gowda (Preferred name: Hema). My pronouns are She/Her.
I'm a master's student in Information Systems and Management at CMU, where I am pursuing my passion for technology and innovation. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Banglore Institute of Technology, where I graduated with a CGPA of 8.54/10. I have also worked as a java developer and a project associate at SAP Labs India, where I developed microservices, executed portfolio workshops, and improved code quality. Additionally, I have published two research papers on brain tumor detection and organizational behavior in international journals. My goal is to leverage my education and experience to contribute to the technological field and solve real-world problems.

Interested in: Business Analytics, Data Analysis with Tableau, Product/Program/Project/Operations Management 

# What I hope to learn
We deal with a lot of data in our everyday life, but see very few visualizations that convey the point easily. I hope to master the skill of effectively visualizing data tailored to different stakeholders to convey an idea/insight. I hope to utilise it in delivering better presentations to executive stakeholers and senior management after graduation to help them in decision-making by gathering impactful insights from the data.
