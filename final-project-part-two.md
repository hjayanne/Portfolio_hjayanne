# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for my final project includes college students and early career professionals, specifically those who are scared that AI might take their jobs. This applies to degrees or professions like data entry jobs, HR-related roles, etc, that can easily be automated using artificial intelligence.  This audience is not afraid to use AI but is worried that there might not be jobs left for them to do because AI has taken over. 
We will identify how companies are quickly adopting AI over human workers, analyze the jobs at high risk of automation in the tech industry, and ultimately recommend key skills required to stay employable in today’s AI-driven job market. 
To narrow down my target audience further, I will concentrate on college students in the US comprising all degrees(because many non-STEM students also end up in tech). According to Mission Graduate, the number of college students in the United States is estimated to reach 19.25 million in 2024 ([Reference Link](https://missiongraduatenm.org/college-enrollment-statistics/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20college%20students,enrolled%20in%20colleges%20and%20universities.))By focusing on this audience, my project’s findings will help them navigate today’s job market. 


## Interview script

I identified three people with different backgrounds to help with the interviews:

1. **Interviewee 1 (Female, Age 25):** A professional with a business background currently working in a tech-related business role.
2.	**Interviewee 2 (Male, Age 25):** A STEM graduate.
3.	**Interviewee 3 (Female, Age 25):** A Computer Science undergrad in India aspiring to enter the US job market.


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| How the website looks to the audience | What do you think of the website? Any suggestions on how the site is built? | 
| How the story is being perceived | Can you tell me what you think this website is telling? |
| Understand if the insights were clear(1)  | Were the insights that AI is replacing jobs clear? |
| Understand if the insights were clear(2) | Were the insights about AI creating jobs clear? |
| Understand Data Visualizations’ clarity | What would you change in the data visualizations, if any? |
| Additional feedback/suggestions to improve the story | Is there anything else I can add to make my story more impactful? |

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What do you think of the website? Any suggestions on how the site is built? | The site is easy to navigate, but some pages are dynamic in the sense it has a nice flow but then the flow stops with some text and data viz. | Change the first background image to make the text look more clear and easy to read. As I was scrolling, I liked that the visualizations were interactive. | Cool website, but it didn't seem choerent like a brand presentation or blog with similar colour or patterns. |
| Can you tell me what you think this website is telling? | It is basically using data to show how AI is replacing certain jobs and also creating new ones.| People think AI is taking away jobs, but in reality, it’s creating more jobs also. | So, you are showing how AI adoption has increased and how people think its taking away jobs, but you also show the positive side of it, like it creates jobs too. |
| Were the insights that AI is replacing jobs clear? | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Were the insights about AI creating jobs clear? | Kind of, the data viz what you showed about jobs at high risk didn't make sense.| Yes, but maybe use more data to support your story. | Yeah, its clear. |
| What would you change in the data visualizations, if any? | Change the sizing of the visuals like pie chart, person chart, etc| One viz was hard to interpret, it said three count of AI researchers’ jobs are at high risk. Only 3? Try to find more data. | Make all the colours a bit similar like a brand template, there should a clear theme like maybe use blue graphics and background images to relate to AI. |
| Is there anything else I can add to make my story more impactful? | Make some text based numbers bigger and add colour.| Put actual stories of people who lost their jobs to AI. | Can you add facts like xyz people lost jobs to AI according to abc research/company in the current flow? |



# Identified changes for Part III

Below are the changes that came out of the user interviews that I plan to implement for my final project part 3.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection | I will find more data for jobs at risk due to AI in the tech industry & skills required |
| Textual Changes | Make text bigger, highlight numbers with bigger fonts and colours |
| Website Flow | Make it more coherent with smooth dynamic transitions and colour theme, update background images |
| Tableau Changes | Making the size of data vizzes better so that it fits well and is readable |
| Impactfulness | Add testimonials of people who lost their jobs to AI and facts about AI's effect on the job market |

Thank you!
