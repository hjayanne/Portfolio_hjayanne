# User research 

## Target audience
The target audience for my final project includes college students and early career professionals, specifically those who are scared that AI might take their jobs. This applies to degrees or professions like data entry jobs, HR-related roles, etc, that can easily be automated using artificial intelligence.  This audience is not afraid to use AI but is worried that there might not be jobs left for them to do because AI has taken over. 
We will identify how companies are quickly adopting AI over human workers, analyze the jobs at high risk of automation in the tech industry, and ultimately recommend key skills required to stay employable in today’s AI-driven job market. 
To narrow down my target audience further, I will concentrate on college students in the US comprising all degrees(because many non-STEM students also end up in tech). According to Mission Graduate, the number of college students in the United States is estimated to reach 19.25 million in 2024 ([Reference Link](https://missiongraduatenm.org/college-enrollment-statistics/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20college%20students,enrolled%20in%20colleges%20and%20universities.))By focusing on this audience, my project’s findings will help them navigate today’s job market. 


## Interview script

I identified three people with different backgrounds to help with the interviews:

1. **Interviewee 1 (Female, Age 25):** A professional with a business background currently working in a tech-related business role.
2.	**Interviewee 2 (Male, Age 25):** A STEM graduate.
3.	**Interviewee 3 (Female, Age 25):** A Computer Science undergrad in India aspiring to enter the US job market.
