# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

With the feedback I received from the three interviews I conducted for Part 2 of this project, I made a few changes. I realized the data for this to come from a reputed source will maybe take a few more years because it is easy to get how many jobs there are today on LinkedIn, but to get the same stats for previous years on AI particularly is hard to find. So, I decided to remove one data visualization that was not very helpful in supporting my story. I increased the sizes of the text and added colors to highlight a few words. I used almost perfectly alternating dark and light themes to reflect the negative and positive side of AI, changed the layout a bit, and added new design components. I updated all the data vizzes to render correctly based on the professor’s feedback from last week. I found a few testimonials about people who lost their jobs to AI and a success story of a person who landed his first Data Analytics job with the help of a tool I recommended in the call to action.

I have added references to all the sources I used as links wherever I have mentioned them. I realized that if the data you want is not available, you can try to put your point across with whatever data you have right now instead of waiting for the perfect dataset. I still don’t have data on what tech jobs are at risk because of AI, but this search did help me target a different audience. I really think the Setup, Conflict, and Resolution method works really well, I start with a topic that most students agree upon like AI takes jobs, but then break that with a reality of how AI is also providing jobs with data to support it. Finally, I am able to recommend which skills are important and how to learn those skills and get started. 

# The audience

I felt that most tech students would know how to navigate AI, but so many other students don’t. However, people who are from non-CS backgrounds still end up in the tech industry. I have personally seen a few seniors at my ex-company who have sales, customer service, and finance backgrounds and are now leading software product solutions for many countries at big tech companies. This has made me think more about which audience can benefit most from my analysis. 

With this “Eureka” moment, my target audience is narrowed down to college students who are enrolled in non-computer science degrees. This includes students who think their future jobs might need good technical skills as well to do their job, and also those students who started with a job in a non-tech role but realized this isn’t enjoyable for them and want to shift careers. But they wouldn’t know what skills are in demand, what skills are being automated by AI, and what skills they need to learn to land a job in this AI-driven job market. So, I want them to understand how AI can be helpful in doing their job rather than focusing on AI taking their jobs and be well prepared to navigate not just the job market but also the tech industry. 


# Final thoughts

I ran out of time to find the data to support the initial story idea I had. I got excited about the fact that this information might not be very helpful to some with the same background as me, but it would benefit so many other students with a business background who want to be managers in a big tech company or any non-cs role. I was really unhappy with my story in part 2 because it seemed like a very obvious thing to me and everyone I was around and would be presenting to. But when this bubble burst, I realized this could help so many other people. This makes me very happy to be able to tell a story that will benefit my target audience.
