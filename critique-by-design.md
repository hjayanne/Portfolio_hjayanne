# Assignment 3&4: Critique by design
We will critique the "Meat production down 8.1% in 2022" data viz for this analysis.

## Step one: the visualization
DataViz selected from MakeoverMondayUK- [Meat production down 8.1% in 2022](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2023/02/PE23_051_413.html)

I was drawn to this viz because I consume meat regularly and wanted to understand how meat production has dropped in Germany. I was particularly interested in poultry as I love chicken.

## Step two: the critique
**What stood out/worked well:** The color differentiations were good to separate beef, poultry, and pork. It looks clean and without clutter. When you hover over the graph, it shows what amount of meat was produced in all 3 categories for that year.

**What didn’t work well:** Title of the article clearly states that meat production is down 8.1% in 2022 but it is not clear in the title of the line chart. The Y-axis labels are nice on the right, but should also be on the left according to standard. Below the title, it says “2000=100” – are they talking about the years or amount of meat, it is unclear. It should show the lines in such a way that the 8% decrease is evident, but as of now I need to look at the article’s title to connect the dots.

**What I would do differently:** Put the Y-axis labels on the left and right side. Highlight the points from 2021 and 2022 to show a clear difference, and maybe use dotted lines up until 2021 and from 2021-2022 a solid line, this way we can still provide context from historical data instead of it being distracting to the audience. I would clearly specify what “2000=100” means, maybe that it is pertaining to the X-axis, and for each 100 spaces on the plot, it shows one year, and maybe increase the Y-axis label splits, instead of 50 units, we can do 25 to show a clear decrease in the meat production in 2022 compared to 2021.

I think the **primary audience** is everyone in the world who consumes meat, produces meat, or runs their business on meat. On the other hand, the audience could also be people who are promoting veganism, who are environmentally conscious, etc. The viz is accurate in terms of representing the data, but it does not do a good job of letting the audience know what the idea is in one glance. If the audience was a company that produces meat, maybe we can showcase the decrease from 2021-2022 in red by combining all 3 categories into 1, and then go into details with 3 lines, dotted till 2021 and solid form 2021-2022, provoking them to engage with the plot and ask questions like why did this happen, what can we do to increase the consumption, etc.

**Final thoughts:** This method was effective in identifying the good/bad elements, similar to the Good Charts method, but this felt easier. I feel it covers all possible measures for now.
Recommendations would be to update the title like “Meat production dropped by 8% from 2021-2022 in Germany”, use dotted lines till 2021 and solid for 2021-2022, since it is time based data, line graph is probably the best option, and lastly I would also add annotations/text boxes near 2021/2022 to allow the audience to come to the main idea with a quick glance. 
In doing the above critique, I was clearly able to see what things worked well and what didn’t, making it easier for me as a designer to make relevant changes as I have detailed above. I enjoyed using this critique method.

## Step three: Sketch a solution
While sketching out, I added Y-axis labels on both sides, dividers for 2021, and 2022, modified the title for more clarity, added a text box to highlight focus on the 8% drop from 2021-2022, used dotted lines till 2021, and solid from 2021 onwards, to not distract the audience from the main idea of discussion.

## Step four: Test the solution
Interview 1: Student, late 20’s
Interview 2: Student, mid 20’s

| Question                                             | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|1. Can you tell me what you think this is? | 2021-2022 quantity of  Meat produced in Germany and how it has dropped.|A graph that shows comparison of maybe different meats and for each meat type how much the production dropped, eyes didn’t go to the title at first- too long|
|2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?|From 2000 to 2021 there’s a gradual increase in meat production, and then dropped in 2022|The meat production dropped in 2022, especially for the first meat, than the other two.|
|3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?| Labels were missing, it is interesting to see why there is a drop, reason behind it.|Labels are missing, and is the drop by 8% for all 3 types of meats or is it combined, its confusing. I would want to know the percent drop for each, so update the title accordingly.|
|4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?|Maybe meat producers, citizens for the awareness and transform them to veganism.|Food industry, majorly who are promoting veganism.|
|5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?|Add labels to distinguish 3 meat categories and also add colors to them.|Adding labels for 3 meats, drop by % for each. Title - shorten the title, since we are doing % drop for each,  just mention drop in meat prod, instead of drop by 8%, mention Germany in the beginning, year is mostly at the end of a sentence.|
|6. What do you feel about the visual effects like (solid Vs dotted) lines?|The visual effects seem to be clear but adding colors would help.|Looks good, liked the divider for 2021, and 2022.|
|7. If you had to change something in this viz, what is it?|No, line graph works best for a time-related data.|I think everything is clean and the line plot works well.|
|8. Do you think it needs more context? If yes, how would you include it here?|It is descriptive enough, I don’t see how you can add more context here.|No, its pretty straight forward.|


### Synthesis:

**Feedback Learnings:**
During the interviews both identified a detail I missed to add in my sketch, labels. Both were able to get a little bit of the main idea of the graph which is the year about which we’re going to focus on. With respect to context, since the sketch has historical data, they didn’t seem to need more context. Both suggested slightly different changes to the title, which I will implement in my redesign. 

**Design Changes Suggested:**
Title – Put “Germany” in the beginning of the sentence, and year at the end. If you mention % drops for each of the meat category, just mention “drop” instead of “8%”, and shorten it a bit if possible.
Legend – Add labels and different colors of the 3 meat categories.
Rest, I will implement what I sketched out and include the above suggestions too.

## Step five: build the solution
While building my own design on tableau, it took a lot of time and debugging to implement the design choices I wanted, so I instead followed along with this [#WatchMeViz tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZY8J2mT6Wo&list=PLX-uPHRG0cLb697Ie-ZGSObRLLNhxzJGK&index=52)

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1731449183719');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='900px';vizElement.style.height='627px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='900px';vizElement.style.height='627px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

This redesign that Andy showed made these changes to the original viz: 
-	added labels to differentiate between beef, pork, and poultry
-	added index label as well to make it easy for the viewer to understand what quantity was produced in comparison to the quantity produced in the year 2000. 
-	Shifted the Y-axis labels to the left to stay aligned with standard convention and added a more clear title for the Y-axis.
-	Updated the title, added a subtitle, and a caption for the data source and citations.
-	X-axis now shows years that are 2 years apart, whereas the original viz showed a 5 year jump.

Thus, this final redesign talks about how meat production in Germany has dropped instead of a 8% combined drop, with details about the 3 meat categories in comparison of quantity produced in 2000. This way we are staying accurate even in our title. As a meat eater myself, I recently started consuming vegan products and I might shift to vegan products completely soon, so it is very interesting to see that many people even in Germany are consuming lesser meat and maybe that’s why meat production has also reduced.
